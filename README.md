My Java Script file recursiveFunctionrecursiveReverseStringFunction contains five different ways to reverse the string using Recursion tecnique. I have chosen one of the ways I used for explanation and how it works.

Reverse String by recursion using slice() and lengt() methods.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Base Case:
----------

The if (inputString.length <= 1) condition serves as the base case for the recursion. If the input string is empty or contains only one character, it is already reversed, so the function returns it directly, preventing infinite recursion.

Recursive Case:
---------------

inputString[inputString.length-1] extracts the last character of the inputString.
inputString.slice(0, inputString.length - 1) creates a new string containing all characters of inputString except the last one.

reverseString1(inputString.slice(0, inputString.length - 1)) recursively calls the reverseString1 function with this shorter string.

The function then concatenates the extracted last character with the result of the recursive call. This effectively builds the reversed string by progressively moving characters from the end of the original string to the beginning of the reversed string.

Example:
--------

If inputString is "hello":

Let's trace how the call stack works with recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hello") example:

recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hello") is called: This function is pushed onto the call stack.

Inside recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hello"):
---------------------------------------------

The if condition ("hello".length <= 1) is false.
It executes the recursive part: "o" + recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hell")

recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hell") is called: This function is pushed onto the call stack (now on top of the previous call).

Inside recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hell"):
--------------------------------------------
The if condition ("hell".length <= 1) is false.
It executes the recursive part: "l" + recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hel")
recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hel") is called: This function is pushed onto the call stack.

Inside recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hel"):
-------------------------------------------
The if condition ("hel".length <= 1) is false.
It executes the recursive part: "l" + recursiveReverseStringSlice1("he")
recursiveReverseStringSlice1("he") is called: This function is pushed onto the call stack.

Inside recursiveReverseStringSlice1("he"):
------------------------------------------
The if condition ("he".length <= 1) is false.
It executes the recursive part: "e" + recursiveReverseStringSlice1("h")
recursiveReverseStringSlice1("h") is called: This function is pushed onto the call stack.

Inside recursiveReverseStringSlice1("h"):
-----------------------------------------
The if condition ("h".length <= 1) is true.
It returns "h".

recursiveReverseStringSlice1("h") is popped off the stack.
----------------------------------------------------------
Back in recursiveReverseStringSlice1("he"):
It receives "h" from the previous call.
It returns "e" + "h" which is "eh".

recursiveReverseStringSlice1("he") is popped off the stack.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Back in recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hel"):
It receives "eh" from the previous call.
It returns "l" + "eh" which is "leh".

recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hel") is popped off the stack.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Back in recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hell"):
It receives "leh" from the previous call.
It returns "l" + "leh" which is "lleh".

recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hell") is popped off the stack.
------------------------------------------------------------
Back in recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hello"):
It receives "lleh" from the previous call.
It returns "o" + "lleh" which is "olleh".
recursiveReverseStringSlice1("hello") is popped off the stack. 
The final result, "olleh", is then logged to the console. 

This step-by-step process of functions being added and removed from the call stack is fundamental to how JavaScript executes your code, especially with recursive functions. 
 

Demonstration of Advanced Skills:
---------------------------------

This implementation demonstrates advanced skills in several areas:

Recursion:
----------
The function effectively utilizes recursion to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.

String Manipulation:
--------------------
It employs string indexing (inputString[inputString.length-1]) and string slicing (inputString.slice()) for efficient manipulation of string data.

Algorithmic Thinking:
---------------------
The structure of the function reflects a clear understanding of how to design an algorithm for string reversal using a recursive approach.

Conciseness and Readability:
----------------------------
The code is relatively concise and easy to understand, showcasing refined technique in code writing.
