Reverse String by recursion using slice() and lengt() methods.

Base Case:

The if (inputString.length <= 1) condition serves as the base case for the recursion. If the input string is empty or contains only one character, it is already reversed, so the function returns it directly, preventing infinite recursion.

Recursive Case:

inputString[inputString.length-1] extracts the last character of the inputString.
inputString.slice(0, inputString.length - 1) creates a new string containing all characters of inputString except the last one.

reverseString1(inputString.slice(0, inputString.length - 1)) recursively calls the reverseString1 function with this shorter string.

The function then concatenates the extracted last character with the result of the recursive call. This effectively builds the reversed string by progressively moving characters from the end of the original string to the beginning of the reversed string.

Example:

If inputString is "hello":
 reverseString1("hello") returns 'o' +
 reverseString1("hell"), reverseString1("hell") returns 'l' +
 reverseString1("hel"), reverseString1("hel") returns 'l' +
 reverseString1("he"), reverseString1("he") returns 'e' + 
 reverseString1("h"), and reverseString1("h") returns 'h' (base case).

Substituting back: 'e' + 'h' becomes "eh, 'l' + "eh" becomes "leh, 'l' + "leh" becomes "lleh, and 'o' + "lleh" becomes "olleh.

Thus, the function successfully reverses the input string using recursion.

Demonstration of Advanced Skills:

This implementation demonstrates advanced skills in several areas:

Recursion:
The function effectively utilizes recursion to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.

String Manipulation:
It employs string indexing (inputString[inputString.length-1]) and string slicing (inputString.slice()) for efficient manipulation of string data.

Algorithmic Thinking:
The structure of the function reflects a clear understanding of how to design an algorithm for string reversal using a recursive approach.

Conciseness and Readability:
The code is relatively concise and easy to understand, showcasing refined technique in code writing.
